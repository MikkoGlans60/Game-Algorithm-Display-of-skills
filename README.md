# Game-Algorithm-Display-of-skills
Code for school task in Game algorithms

This Code was made by me to our first enemy implementation in our game project and it has foundations to even attack the player, but we decided to make different kind of AI to the enemies.
In the build you control the player by clicking a surface in the "gameboard". enemy has a patrol area and when the player goes inside the AI's sighting range, the AI starts to chase the player
If the player goes outside the sighting range, AI will fall back to its original patrol area.
